# Patrick Barney Portfolio

This is my first website built from the ground up!
This website will be continually developed to be used as a location for employers to see my work.
The site uses links in the header to navigate the user to relevant areas of the site.
The site includes a little bit of background info about me.
It also includes links to applications.
These applications are still pending completions, as the site itself is still a continual work in progress.

Below are some screenshots of the site.

I hope you enjoy exploring the site.
This site is not open for contributions, as it is a portfolio that should be strictly comprised of my own work.
